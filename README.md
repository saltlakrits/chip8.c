# Naive Chip-8 emulator

Simple Chip-8 emulator, should be fully compatible (but not with any variants) except for sound (which is just a beep in Chip-8 anyway)

Some things are rather naive, things like screen resolution is hardcoded. Making it actually broadly useful wasn't the goal as much as learning about emulators!

Have some sort of dream about writing simple fragment shaders to make it look snazzy, but I would have to learn about shaders from basically the ground up, so...
